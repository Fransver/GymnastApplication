# Gymnast Application

My application focuses on an optimal individual learning trajectory for a gymnast. An application
that guides an athlete to achieve a desired goal. The application provides multiple courses and
within each course multiple intermediate steps and training options to the aspired goal. It uses
reflection from the user to suggest alternative routes that better suit the athlete's current skill-level.

### Goal 1: Give insight in the methodology of multiple core-gymnastic-elements.
### Goal 2: Raise the enthusiasm of training.
### Goal 3: Prevent unnecessary injuries.
### Goal 4: Bundling knowledge of different methodologies.
